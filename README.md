# Falling Bricks Game

This is the home page for a game of my creation called **Falling Bricks**. It is basically a clone of the famous Tetris game for Android phones and Nokia C3		(and other feature phones supporting **Java ME**).

## Build Environment

* Java 8
* NetBeans 8.1 with bundled Java ME SDK
* Android Studio 2.2.2
* Android Target SDK - 21
* Android Build tools 25.0.2
* Ubuntu 14.04 for Android
* Windows for J2ME 

## About Me
I am Aaron Baffour-Awuah, a software enthusiast and developer for the past 5 years. It has become a habit of mine to break into a new software platform by developing a game for it. My first programs for the Java Applet and Java Swing platforms were mostly games.

By the ending of September 2014 I had developed Falling Bricks for my Nokia C3 (and therefore other feature phones supporting Java ME).

By ending of April 2015, I had ported the Java ME version of Falling Bricks to Android, making it my first Android application.
